/*
 *
 * The user can launch application as follows:
 *
 * TaskA <filename> <search term> [-regex]
 * 
 * <database file>              REQUIRED. Specifies the file to search (required). This is ALWAYS the first parameter. The file must exist in order to be searched
 * <search term>                REQUIRED. The search term as either a single word or a regular expression. 
                                This is a single word, made up of alpha-numeric characters only.
 * -regex                       OPTIONAL. If this flag is present, then the search term is a regular expression (as opposed to a single word). 
                                It must be a valid regex expression.
 *
 * ****************
 * *** EXAMPLES ***
 * ****************
 *
 * TaskA lorum.txt comp1000             Searches for the string comp1000 in the file lorum.txt
 * TaskA lorum.txt "^(\\d)\\d" -regex   Searches the file lorum.txt for all patterns that match the regular expression "^(\\d)\\d" 
 * TaskA lorum.txt -regex "^(\\d)\\d"   Searches the file lorum.txt for all patterns that match the regular expression "^(\\d)\\d" 
 * TaskA lorum.txt                      Error - search expression provided
 * 
 * *************
 * *** NOTES ***
 * *************
 *
 * o Try to write your code such that is can be reused in other tasks.
 * o Code should be consistently indented and commented
 * o Consider error conditions, such as missing parameters or non-existent files
